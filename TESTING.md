Testing was something I did throughout the build process. I leaned heavily on Google Dev Tools to help with responsive layout and getting the pages to look as I wanted them to and troubleshoot issues that arose.

I've tested the sites responsiveness across multiple browsers and devices to try and cover a wide range. I don't have access to any Apple based products, so my testing on Safari is limited.

## Automated Testing

### W3 Validator - HTML

[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) has been used to ensure the validity of the HTML markup across the project.
