Testing was something I did throughout the build process. I leaned heavily on Google Dev Tools to help with responsive layout and getting the pages to look as I wanted them to and troubleshoot issues that arose.

I've tested the sites responsiveness across multiple browsers and devices to try and cover a wide range. I don't have access to any Apple based products, so my testing on Safari is limited.

## Automated Testing

### W3 Validator - HTML

[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) has been used to ensure the validity of the HTML markup across the project.

- [Index/Home](https://github.com/mnevison/milestone-p1/blob/ddd18638d990563bd3b3b20eff3bf24a66434161/testing/w3/home-w3.png) - Passed with no errors or warnings.
- [Experience](https://github.com/mnevison/milestone-p1/blob/c4acd944e06f9db976363adf68ed2a1355c68884/testing/w3/experience-w3.png) - Passed with no errors or warnings.
- [Projects](https://github.com/mnevison/milestone-p1/blob/c4acd944e06f9db976363adf68ed2a1355c68884/testing/w3/projects-w3.png) - Passed with no errors or warnings. I did need to go back to my HTML and troubleshoot some errors initially relating to a stray " left when I moved my .active class for my navbar styling.
- [Contact](https://github.com/mnevison/milestone-p1/blob/2f4658d5dfb6b8ac6d4c05e46f7bf57dd1ff6b55/testing/w3/w3-contact.png) - Passed with no errors or warnings. Needed to remove a mis-placed alt tag in response to initial errors on the page.

### W3 Jigsaw - CSS

[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validated my CSS document(s). My project contains 2 files, a "global" one, which contains styles for elements that appear across each page and a regular style.css file. When providing a direct link to the site it will check all CSS files. 

* [CSS](https://github.com/mnevison/milestone-p1/blob/de46a3b5fe080bcb6225bfa0ff55fc119d62551f/testing/w3/jigsaw-css.png) - No errors found.
