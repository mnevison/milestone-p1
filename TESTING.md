Testing was something I did throughout the build process. I leaned heavily on Google Dev Tools to help with responsive layout and getting the pages to look as I wanted them to and troubleshoot issues that arose. 

I've tested the sites responsiveness across multiple browsers and devices to try and cover a wide range. I don't have access to any Apple based products, so my testing on Safari is limited.
